**Audit Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Owner:** Sav Bhelke  

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. NOT INDEXED BY GOOGLE
```
Search: site:canyoncrowntreeco.com
Result: 0 pages indexed
```
**This is the #1 problem.** The site exists but Google hasn't indexed it. No one can find Canyon Crown via search.

**Immediate Action:**
1. Set up Google Search Console
2. Verify site ownership
3. Submit sitemap manually
4. Request indexing for all pages

### 2. SITEMAP URL MISMATCH
- `robots.txt` points to: `https://www.canyoncrowntreeco.com/sitemap.xml`
- Actual site loads at: `https://canyoncrowntreeco.com` (no www)
- This confuses search engines

**Fix:** Either:
- Redirect www → non-www (or vice versa)
- Update robots.txt to match actual URL structure

### 3. PLACEHOLDER PHONE NUMBER
Homepage shows: `801-555-1234` — this is a fake number.
**Must replace with real business phone ASAP.**

## 🟡 HIGH-PRIORITY SEO IMPROVEMENTS

### 4. NO CITY-SPECIFIC LANDING PAGES
**This is the biggest SEO gap vs competitors.**

Diamond Tree Experts has dedicated pages for:
- Salt Lake City
- Draper
- Sandy
- Ogden
- Layton
- Riverton

Canyon Crown lists cities but has **zero city landing pages**.

**Recommended pages to create:**
- `/salt-lake-city/` — "Tree Service Salt Lake City | Canyon Crown Tree Co"
- `/sandy/` — "Tree Removal & Trimming Sandy UT | Canyon Crown"
- `/draper/` — "Draper Tree Service | ISA Certified Arborists"
- `/park-city/` — "Park City Tree Care | Mountain Tree Experts"
- `/cottonwood-heights/` — "Tree Service Cottonwood Heights"
- `/holladay/` — "Tree Removal Holladay Utah"
- `/murray/` — "Murray Tree Service | Canyon Crown"
- `/millcreek/` — "Tree Care Millcreek UT"
- `/south-jordan/` — "South Jordan Tree Service"
- `/riverton/` — "Tree Removal Riverton Utah"

Each page should have:
- City name in H1
- Local content (neighborhoods, landmarks, common tree issues)
- Service area map
- City-specific testimonials if available
- Unique content (not just copied from homepage)

### 5. NO GOOGLE BUSINESS PROFILE
Cannot find a verified GBP for Canyon Crown Tree Co.

**Must set up:**
1. Create/claim Google Business Profile
2. Verify location
3. Add photos, services, hours
4. Start collecting Google reviews
5. Respond to all reviews

### 6. NO SCHEMA MARKUP
Need to add structured data for:
- `LocalBusiness` schema
- `Service` schema for each service
- `Review` schema for testimonials
- `FAQPage` schema for FAQ sections

### 7. NO BLOG/CONTENT SECTION
Competitors use blog content for organic traffic:
- "Best Trees for Utah Climate"
- "When to Remove a Tree in Salt Lake"
- "Iron Chlorosis in Utah Maples"
- "Storm Damage: What to Do First"
