<h1>When Should You Remove a Tree? 7 Warning Signs</h1>

<div class="article-content">
<p class="lead">At Canyon Crown Tree, we believe in preservation first — we never recommend removing a tree unless it's truly necessary. But some trees do become hazards that threaten your home, family, or neighbors. Here are the 7 warning signs that indicate a tree may need to come down.</p>

<h2>1. Dead or Dying Tree</h2>
<p>A dead tree is an unpredictable tree. Without living tissue to maintain strength, dead wood becomes brittle and can fail without warning. Signs of a dead or dying tree include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No leaves during growing season (deciduous) or brown/falling needles (conifers)</li>
<li>Bark falling off in sheets</li>
<li>Mushrooms or fungi growing at the base</li>
<li>Extensive woodpecker activity (they're finding insects in dead wood)</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Major Trunk Damage</h2>
<p>The trunk is a tree's structural foundation. Look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large cracks or splits in the trunk</li>
<li>Cavities or hollow sections</li>
<li>Missing bark (dead spots) covering more than 25% of circumference</li>
<li>Signs of internal decay (soft, punky wood)</li>
</ul>
<p>Minor damage can sometimes be managed, but severe trunk compromise often means removal is the safest option.</p>

<h2>3. Root Problems</h2>
<p>Roots anchor and feed the tree. Warning signs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mushrooms growing at the base (indicates root rot)</li>
<li>Heaving soil on one side of the tree</li>
<li>Recent construction that cut major roots</li>
<li>Visible root decay or damage</li>
<li>Tree leaning that has recently changed</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Dangerous Lean</h2>
<p>Many trees grow with a slight lean naturally. But be concerned if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lean has recently increased</li>
<li>Soil is heaving at the base</li>
<li>The tree is leaning toward a structure, power line, or frequently used area</li>
<li>Roots are visibly lifting on one side</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Proximity to Structures</h2>
<p>Sometimes healthy trees become hazardous simply due to location:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large trees too close to your home (roots affecting foundation, branches overhanging roof)</li>
<li>Trees growing into power lines</li>
<li>Trees blocking emergency access or sightlines</li>
<li>Trees shading solar panels or gardens where sun is needed</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Storm Damage</h2>
<p>After a storm, assess your trees carefully:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 50% of the crown is damaged</li>
<li>Large limbs torn from the trunk (leaving wounds that won't heal)</li>
<li>Splitting where major branches meet the trunk</li>
<li>Tree struck by lightning (internal damage may not be visible)</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Disease or Pest Infestation</h2>
<p>Some conditions can be treated, but others are death sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Untreatable:</strong> Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer (once established), severe fire blight</li>
<li><strong>Potentially treatable:</strong> Iron chlorosis, minor fungal infections, aphid infestations</li>
</ul>
<p>A certified arborist can determine if treatment is worthwhile or if removal is the better option.</p>

<h2>When in Doubt, Get a Professional Assessment</h2>
<p>Tree assessment isn't always straightforward. What looks dangerous might be stable, and what looks fine might be compromised internally. An ISA Certified arborist can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate the tree's overall health and structure</li>
<li>Use specialized tools to detect internal decay</li>
<li>Assess root health and stability</li>
<li>Recommend treatment alternatives when removal isn't necessary</li>
<li>Provide documentation for insurance claims if needed</li>
</ul>
