<h1>Iron Chlorosis in Utah Trees: Causes, Symptoms & Treatment</h1>

<div class="article-content">
<p class="lead">If your maple, oak, or other deciduous tree has leaves that are turning yellow while the veins stay green, you're likely dealing with iron chlorosis — the most common tree health problem in Utah and the Intermountain West.</p>

<h2>What Causes Iron Chlorosis?</h2>
<p>Contrary to what many homeowners think, iron chlorosis usually isn't caused by a lack of iron in the soil. Instead, it's caused by Utah's highly alkaline (high pH) soils, which "lock up" iron and make it unavailable to trees.</p>
<p>When soil pH rises above 7.0 (Utah soils commonly range from 7.5 to 8.5), iron becomes chemically bound and trees can't absorb it through their roots — even if plenty of iron is present in the soil.</p>

<h2>Which Trees Are Most Susceptible?</h2>
<p>Some trees are more sensitive to alkaline soils than others:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High susceptibility:</strong> Silver maple, red maple, pin oak, white oak, sweet gum, birch</li>
<li><strong>Moderate susceptibility:</strong> Norway maple, crabapple, mountain ash</li>
<li><strong>Low susceptibility:</strong> Honeylocust, hackberry, ash (though ash faces other threats)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Symptoms of Iron Chlorosis</h2>
<p>Look for these telltale signs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interveinal chlorosis:</strong> Leaves turn yellow or pale green while veins remain dark green</li>
<li><strong>New growth affected first:</strong> Symptoms typically appear on the newest leaves</li>
<li><strong>Leaf scorch:</strong> In severe cases, leaf edges turn brown and crispy</li>
<li><strong>Stunted growth:</strong> Chronically affected trees grow slowly</li>
<li><strong>Branch dieback:</strong> Severe, untreated cases can kill branches</li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment Options</h2>

<h3>1. Soil Treatments</h3>
<p>For mild cases, soil acidification can help. Applying elemental sulfur or iron sulfate around the drip line can gradually lower pH. However, Utah's naturally alkaline soils make this challenging to maintain.</p>

<h3>2. Trunk Injections</h3>
<p>The most effective treatment for moderate to severe chlorosis is trunk injection with iron compounds. This delivers iron directly to the tree's vascular system, bypassing the soil problem entirely. Results are visible within weeks and can last 2-3 years.</p>

<h3>3. Chelated Iron Applications</h3>
<p>Chelated iron (iron bound to organic compounds) is more available to trees in alkaline soils. It can be applied as a soil drench or foliar spray, though results are less dramatic than trunk injections.</p>

<h2>Prevention: Choosing the Right Tree</h2>
<p>The best long-term solution is planting trees adapted to alkaline soils:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos)</li>
<li>Kentucky coffeetree</li>
<li>Bur oak</li>
<li>Hackberry</li>
<li>Austrian pine</li>
<li>Blue spruce (native to Utah)</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Call an Arborist</h2>
<p>If your tree shows symptoms of iron chlorosis, a certified arborist can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirm the diagnosis (other problems can cause similar symptoms)</li>
<li>Test soil pH and recommend treatments</li>
<li>Perform trunk injections safely and effectively</li>
<li>Assess whether treatment is worthwhile for severely affected trees</li>
</ul>
